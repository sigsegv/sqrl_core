# sqrl_core
Implementation of core SQRL protocol

https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm

Was based on Dec 2015 protocol, and was able to do initial cryptohandshake with GRC server at that time.

Currently only works on macOS, though only due to OS specific networking logic. Everything else is cross platform.

Only external dependency is libSodium
